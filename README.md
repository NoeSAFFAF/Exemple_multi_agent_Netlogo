# Exemple_multi_agent_Netlogo
A simple problem using netlogo to implement a multi-agent cooperation to solve a multi-goal problem on a 2D space environment

The problem involves two types of agents, static agents on a 2D space tht gives "quests" that can be achieved by reaching a position, and active agent that receive quests and accomplish them. The implementation in netlogo results of a runtime environment in which agents interacts between each other to accomplish their goal.

It is a simple project easy to understand for the purpose of showing some applications of knowledge in multi-agents systems.

### How to use
Need netlogo to run the script, which can be download
